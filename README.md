Got it! Let’s start from **absolute basics** and work through **each concept thoroughly**, making it easy to understand and helping you write clearly in your exam. We'll also include examples and detailed steps wherever necessary.

### **1. Public-Key Cryptography Basics**
- **What is it?**
  - Public-key cryptography is a system that uses **two keys**:
    - **Public Key**: Anyone can know this.
    - **Private Key**: Only the owner knows this.
  - It’s called “asymmetric” because it uses **two different keys**, unlike symmetric cryptography which uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.

#### Why is Public-Key Cryptography Important?
1. **Key Distribution Problem**:
   - In symmetric cryptography, the sender and receiver must share the same key securely. Public-key cryptography solves this by eliminating the need to share a single secret key.
2. **Digital Signatures**:
   - Ensures the authenticity of messages and verifies that the sender is genuine.

### **2. RSA Algorithm (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)**

#### **What is RSA?**
- RSA is the most widely used public-key cryptosystem.
- It is used for:
  - **Encryption**: To secure data.
  - **Digital Signatures**: To verify identity.
  
#### **How does RSA work?**
RSA involves **three main steps**:
1. **Key Generation**: Creating public and private keys.
2. **Encryption**: Converting a message into an unreadable format using the public key.
3. **Decryption**: Using the private key to recover the original message.
